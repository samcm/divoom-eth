# UI Source Components

React source components for 64x64 pixel Divoom display beacon chain visualization.

## Key Patterns
- All views extend routing system with API polling for current view state
- Components use shared BaseLayout and SlotHistory patterns
- Type interfaces centralized in types.ts for consistent API contracts
- View rotation system requires components to be self-contained and stateless

## Critical Constraints  
- Components must render correctly at 64x64 pixels
- Use only pixel fonts from fonts/ directory (PIXY, PixelifySans, dogicapixel)
- Implement high contrast for small display readability
- Keep bundle minimal for fast Playwright screenshot capture
